Coding Dojo Django Fundamentals assignment "Products"


<h1>Assignment: Products</h1>
Using a new Django project, create in your app folder a model for a single table, Product. Complete the below functionality.

<strong>1. Build a new project</strong>
Refer back to the Setup Cheatsheet supplied in Django Intro if needed.

<strong>2. Create a new model called Product</strong>
The models file is found in your app's automatically generated files. If you need a refresher, look back at the last several tabs, especially the models tab.

<strong>3. Add the following fields to the Product class </strong>
A product should have a name, description, weight, price, cost (to seller), and category. Figure out what type should be assigned to each field.

Once all the previous steps are complete, test your code by adding 3 new products. Retrieve all rows from your table and print each to the console.
